# üß† Tarot as System Architecture

## Major Arcana (22 Cards) ‚Üí OS Kernel / Core Libraries
- These represent the fundamental operating principles of the system and the underlying worldview. They govern the basic rules and processes of life and existence.
- In terms of an OS, think of them as process management, memory handling, file system structure.
- For example, "The Fool" is like the entry point of a process‚Äîlaunching unknown code into the wild. "Death" represents garbage collection, process termination, or major refactoring timing.

## Minor Arcana (56 Cards) ‚Üí Application Layer / APIs / Modules
- These correspond to tools and modules used in day-to-day life. They are the user-facing interface or logic of the app layer.
- Think of these as real-world tasks or problems the user system interfaces with.

## üîß Suit Mapping

### Wands ‚Üí Processes / Threads / Execution Flow
- Related to passion, action, and implementing ideas. Analogous to task schedulers, event loops, or process forks.
- In development: "Implementing a new feature" = Wand action.

### Cups ‚Üí UI/UX Layer / Network Protocols
- Since Cups deal with emotion and communication, they align with user interfaces or system-to-system interactions (e.g., APIs, network protocols).
- Team communication, collaboration tools also fall into this category.

### Swords ‚Üí Algorithms / Logic / Error Handling
- Govern thought and logic. Represent actual code, logic correctness, bug fixing, and debugging.
- Covers conditional branches, exception handling, algorithmic design, etc.

### Pentacles ‚Üí Hardware Layer / Database / Resource Management
- Associated with tangible, physical resources. Includes memory, CPU, disk I/O, cloud infrastructure, and funding.
- Also includes deployment environments, cost optimization, storage architecture.

## üîç System Debugging via Spread

A tarot spread can be interpreted like **system log analysis** or a **CI/CD pipeline output**.

It helps identify where issues (bugs, bottlenecks) are occurring and what layer needs optimization‚Äîsimilar to debugging or refactoring.

Examples:
- **Three of Swords** ‚Üí Logic failure, bug detected (likely in algorithms or condition flow)
- **Ten of Pentacles** ‚Üí Stable infrastructure, complete deployment, resource harmony

Use this lens to read the cards as diagnostic outputs from a living system.
